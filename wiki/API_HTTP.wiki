= HTTP functions (in http.js) =

  * `var request = new HTTP.ServerRequest(input, headers)` - creates a new response structure. If running in CGI mode, this is done automatically.

  * `request.cookie` - hash with cookie variables

    * `.data` - content
    * `.headers` - hash with headers
    * `.originalName` - file's original name
  * `request.header(headerName)` - returns request HTTP header

  * `var response = new HTTP.ServerResponse(output)` - creates a new response instance. If running in CGI mode, this is done automatically.
  * `response.write(data)` - outputs `data`
  * `response.header(headers)` - outputs `headers` (hash) as HTTP response headers
  * `response.escape(data)` - converts *<*, *>*, *&*, *"*, *'* to HTML entities
  * `response.cookie(name, value, expires, path, domain, secure, httponly)` - sets a cookie
