= HTTP functions (in http.js) =

== Server-side HTTP ==

Classes: *HTTP.!ServerRequest*, *HTTP.!ServerResponse*. These should be used in CGI/FastCGI scenario to process request and create a response page.

  * `var request = new HTTP.ServerRequest(input, headers)` - creates a new response structure. If running in CGI mode, this is done automatically.
  * `request.get` - hash with GET variables
  * `request.post` - hash with POST variables
  * `request.cookie` - hash with cookie variables
  * `request.method` - HTTP method used (uppercase)
  * `request.files` - hash with uploaded files. Each file has the following properties:
    * `.data` - content
    * `.headers` - hash with headers
    * `.originalName` - file's original name
  * `request.header(headerName)` - returns request HTTP header

  * `var response = new HTTP.ServerResponse(output)` - creates a new response instance. If running in CGI mode, this is done automatically.
  * `response.write(data)` - outputs `data`
  * `response.header(headers)` - outputs `headers` (hash) as HTTP response headers
  * `response.cookie(name, value, expires, path, domain, secure, httponly)` - sets a cookie
  * `response.status(statusCode, [textualRepresentation])` - sets a HTTP response status

== Client-side HTTP ==

Classes: *HTTP.!ClientRequest*, *HTTP.!ClientResponse*. These should be used to create a HTTP request and process/access received data.
