= Installation =

To compile the code, see [Compiling].

After compilation (or if your downloaded binary package):

  # copy the binary file to a reasonable location,
  # copy `v8cgi.conf.yourplatform` to config file location (set at compile time; if unsure, run the binary - it will tell you the correct path),
  # edit the configuration file as needed,
  # copy all files in lib/ to path specified as `Config.libraryPath`.

== Apache - using v8cgi as a module ==

  # compile or download mod_v8cgi (.dll on Windows, .so on Linux)
  # load the resulting module into Apache: `LoadModule v8cgi_module /path/to/the/v8cgi_module.so`
  # assign a `v8cgi-script` handler as necessary
  # optionally, you can specify a different config file for v8cgi in Apache's configuration file: 
{{{
v8cgi_Config /path/to/v8cgi.conf
}}}

*On windows, make sure that v8.dll and bgd.dll are in system path!*


== Apache - using v8cgi as a cgi binary ==

Add the following to apache configuration:
{{{
ScriptAlias /v8cgi/ /YOUR_PATH/
AddHandler v8cgi-handler .ssjs
Action v8cgi-handler /v8cgi/BINARY_NAME
}}}

while substituting:
  * YOUR_PATH with path to your v8cgi directory,
  * BINARY_NAME with name of your v8cgi binary.
