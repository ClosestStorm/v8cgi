After compilation (or if your downloaded binary package):

  # copy the binary file to a reasonable location,
  # copy `v8cgi.conf.yourplatform` to config file location (set at compile time; if unsure, run the binary - it will tell you the correct path),
  # edit the configuration file as needed,
  # copy all .js files in js/ to path specified as `Config.libraryPath`.
