Make sure all relevant includes and libraries are accessible. Try setting these env. paths before compilation:
{{{
set LIBPATH=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Lib;C:\Program Files\mysql\Lib\opt;C:\Program Files\gd\lib;c:\program files\fcgi\lib
set INCLUDE=C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Include;C:\Program Files\gd\include;c:\program files\fcgi\include
}}}
