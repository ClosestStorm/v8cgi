Syntax (Linux/BSD/MacOS/Posix):
{{{
v8cgi [-c configfile] [-d debugger_port] myscript.js
}}}

Syntax (Windows):
{{{
v8cgi.exe [-c configfile] [-d debugger_port] myscript.js

If no `-c` option is specified, then the system-wide config file is used. The location for this file is set at compile time. If no system config file exists, then v8cgi will refuse to run.

The `-d` options specifies a TCP port for the V8 debugger agent to listen at. If no `-d` option is specified, the debugger agent is disabled.
