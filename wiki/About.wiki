#summary v8cgi design goals, history, general info

= About v8cgi =

JavaScript on server is becoming very popular. There are many tools out there; there are also many different JS engines/interpreters to build upon. This document explains why you should try v8cgi - a full-featured scripting environment, powered by Google's V8 engine.

== Server-side JS development is already taken over by Node ==

I believe that diversity is necessary for a healthy ecosystem. While Node has a well-established user base and huge feature set, not everybody must be necessarily enthusiastic about its API, usage, installation, features etc.

Moreover, v8cgi uses a different architectonic paradigm: it represents the more traditional, synchronous server-side programming model. People coming from different languages may find v8cgi's APIs more straightforward.

v8cgi also strongly focuses on CommonJS compatibility. This is one of the primary design goals; I believe that a standardized API is a key value for successfull interoperability.
